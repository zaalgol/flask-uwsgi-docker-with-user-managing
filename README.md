# flask-uwsgi-docker

`flask-uwsgi-docker` is a template for creating a Flask server utilizing uWSGI and Docker containers. This project simplifies the process of deploying Flask applications, making them ready for development and production environments.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker
- Docker Compose (optional, for managing multi-container Docker applications)

### Installing

Follow these steps to get your development environment running:

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/zaalgol/flask-uwsgi-docker.git

2. **Navigate to the project director**

   ```sh
   cd flask-uwsgi-docker

3. **Build the Docker image**

   ```sh
   docker build -t flask-uwsgi-docker .

4. **Run the Docker container**

   ```sh
   docker run -p 8080:8080 flask-uwsgi-docke
   ```

   Alternatively, if you're using Docker Compose to manage multiple containers:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up

## Accessing the Application

- **Localhost**: After starting the application, it can be accessed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
- **Other devices on your network**: Use the host machine's IP address, such as [http://192.168.1.X:8080](http://192.168.1.X:8080).
